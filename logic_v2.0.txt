every day, each buyer competes to buy at the cheapest selling seller.
all buyers offer the cheapest seller their optimum. The buyer with the highest optimum gets the item and leaves the
market. The rest of the buyers goes to compete at the next cheaper seller.
this goes on until all the sellers have sold their item or all the buyers
have bought an item or have been outbid.

    A) ... raise their optimum if they didn't buy an item
    B) ... lower their optimum if they did buy an item

    A) lower their optimum if they didn't sell their item
    B) raise their optimum if they sold their item
